## Overview
The Flutter Fortune App is a fun and interactive mobile application developed using Flutter. It randomly displays a fortune to the user along with falling emojis that add a visual surprise effect. Each fortune corresponds to a specific emoji theme that animates from the top to the bottom of the screen and then disappears, creating an engaging and delightful user experience.

## Features
- Random Fortune Generator: Displays a randomly selected fortune from a predefined list.
- Emoji Animation: Emojis related to the fortune fall from the top of the screen to the bottom and disappear.
- Interactive Button: Users can generate new fortunes and animations by pressing the "Get Fortune" button.
- Smooth Animations: Utilizes Flutter's animation framework for seamless visual effects.

## How It Works

- The app initializes with a blank fortune and no emojis.
- When the user taps the "Get Fortune" button:
1. A random fortune is selected from the list.
2. A set of emojis corresponding to the fortune is generated.
3. The emojis animate from the top to the bottom of the screen and then disappear.
4. Users can repeat the process to receive new fortunes and animations.
